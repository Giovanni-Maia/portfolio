					<p>
						I come from Brazil, from a city called "Belo Horizonte" - yes.. this is where that infamous match between Germany and Brazil (7-1)
						happened in the 2014 World Cup <Icon icon="sad"/>
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						In Brazil, I took my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science back in 2006 and right after that I started working at Accenture Automation &
						Industrial Solutions as a Software Engineer, so I have {currentYear - 2006}+ years of experience in software development.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						I came to Munich to take a Master's Degree in Computer Science, which I finished in 2014, and since then I have been working as a Software
						Engineer, mainly with focus on the Backend and DevOps.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						I have worked in companies big and small, which helped me acquire a great deal of experience. I am an easy going person and in my work
						I tend to put focus on code quality as well as supporting my team mates whenever needed.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						In my free time I like to listen and play music, but I always keep an eye out for new things in tech! Lately I have been studying
						Machine Learning and A.I. in my private projects.
